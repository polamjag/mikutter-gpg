pretty teokure privacy

## idea and plan
* *icon of Twitter is steganograhy-ready in PNG file* (tested with OpenStego, 588*588 PNG file, with my Twitter account: @polamjag, at 2014-07-02 2:05 JST)
* i can embed my public key within my icon file
* when i reply to others who has pubkey in their icon, i can encrypt with their pubkey and send reply
* Twitter client which has private key can decrypt the message/reply
*
